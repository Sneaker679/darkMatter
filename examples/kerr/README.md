PARAMETERS DEFINITION:
- ro -> initial distance from origin;
- rs -> schwarzschild radius of the body curving space-time, also equal to twice the mass;
- a  -> rotating speed of the blackhole and its absolute value must be smaller than half of rs;
- Ïƒ  -> direction of the orbit : 1 means co-rotation and -1 means counter-rotation;
- h  -> initial angular momentum;
- k  -> initial energy or, more specifically, (total energy)/(mc^2).
