- ro -> initial distance from origin;
- rs -> schwarzschild radius of the body curving space-time, also equal to twice the mass;
- Î›  -> the cosmological constant, equal to 1.11e-52 m^-2 by default;
- h  -> initial angular momentum;
- k  -> initial energy or, more specifically, (total energy)/(mc^2).
