# darkMatter
Dark Matter is a scam and we'll prove it (at least we hope so).

The current version of this code is devoid of a number of features needed for the project. Currently, only geodesics differential equations may be calculated.

## Requirements
- sympy

## Usage
Configure and run `run.py` to get results.
